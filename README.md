# Copy to MMD Visemes

This blender add-on was created to easily create copies of viseme shapekeys with the japanese names that MMD animations 
would expect. It is primarily aimed at use for VRChat MMD Worlds to enable your avatar to lipsync and do facial 
expressions to the songs.

After installing the add-on the "MMD Shapekeys" interface will show up in the `Object Data properties` tab (where the 
shapekeys are listed as well)

* **[Prefill Values]** Fill in the existing shapekeys based on their names. Visemes can have a prefix, for the
other shapekeys like _blink_ the names must match. Values that have already been set will not be overwritten.
*  **[Duplicate Shape Keys With MMD Names]** will clone the shapekeys set in the list and give them their Japanese MMD names. 
An empty shapekey will be added below the Visemes, and above the other shapekeys to have them grouped.
